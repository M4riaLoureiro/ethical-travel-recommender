      "To play Monopoly, you'll need a standard Monopoly board game set, which includes the game board, two dice, player tokens, property cards, Chance and Community Chest cards, houses, hotels, and Monopoly money. Hereâ€™s a basic guide on how to play:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Setup:**\n",
      "   - Lay out the board and place the Chance and Community Chest cards on their designated spaces.\n",
      "   - Each player chooses a token and places it on the \"Go\" space.\n",
      "   - Choose a banker to manage the money, property cards, houses, and hotels.\n",
      "   - Each player receives $1,500 in Monopoly money, typically distributed as: two $500s, four $100s, one $50, one $20, two $10s, one $5, and five $1s.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Objective:**\n",
      "   - The goal of Monopoly is to be the last player remaining with any money, having driven your opponents into bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Game Play:**\n",
      "   - Players take turns rolling the dice and moving their tokens clockwise around the board.\n",
      "   - Depending on where you land, you can buy properties, pay rent, draw Chance or Community Chest cards, pay taxes, or go to jail.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Buying Properties:**\n",
      "   - If you land on an unowned property, you can buy it from the bank at its listed price.\n",
      "   - If you choose not to buy, the property is auctioned to the highest bidder.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Paying Rent:**\n",
      "   - If you land on a property owned by another player, you must pay them rent according to the property's rent card. Rent can increase if the owner has built houses or hotels on the property.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Building Houses and Hotels:**\n",
      "   - Once you own all properties in a color group, you can build houses, then hotels, on those properties to increase rent.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Special Spaces:**\n",
      "   - **Chance and Community Chest:** Draw a card and follow the instructions.\n",
      "   - **Income Tax and Luxury Tax:** Pay the bank the specified amount.\n",
      "   - **Go to Jail:** Move directly to jail without passing Go or collecting $200.\n",
      "   - **Free Parking:** This space has no specific rules, but house rules often apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Jail:**\n",
      "   - You can get out of jail by rolling doubles on your next turn, using a \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card, or paying a $50 fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Winning the Game:**\n",
      "   - The game ends when all but one player go bankrupt. The remaining player is the winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, Monopoly can be played with various house rules, and players often introduce their own variations to make the game more enjoyable.\n"
